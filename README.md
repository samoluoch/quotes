## Description

In this app, the user accesses the quote form and fills in the details. The required details include the name of the user, the quote, and the name of the person who phrased the quote. Once they fill in these details and clicks on the Submit button, the quote submitted appears on the list of the already existing quotes. The appearance of the quote is accompanied by a button to read more about the quote, a button to upvote the quote, a button to downvote the quote, and a button to delete the quote. If a quote is deleted, it disappears from the list of quotes.
